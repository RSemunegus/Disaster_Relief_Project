Objective - Using data collected from location sites in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake, analysis using classification algorithms was conducted on the data to determine the location of blue tarps in Haiti. Blue tarps indicated the location of displaced within Haiti. Goal is to determine the locations of these displaced people from location images of Haiti in order to determine where to send resources to help these displaced people. Algorithms that were used included Logisitic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, 

Data - Data was actual data collected from Haiti by a team from the Rochester Institute of Technology that flew an aircraft to collect high resolution geo-referenced imagery
